## Natural Disaster Fake Tweets Detection
This is a repository of research project (WQD7002) consisting of datasets, EDA notebook, classifier module and application

### Objective
1) To implement supervised learning approach and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on the natural disaster tweets.
2) To predict the authenticity of natural disaster tweets using models as built in (i) and evaluate the accuracy of the models.

### Dataset
Source of dataset is obtained and extracted from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vstepanenko/disaster-tweets

### How to deploy the model as web app (Flask)
1) Create a conda virtual environment
2) Install the required packages from requirements.txt
3) Run the app.py file
4) Copy and paste the given Flask IP adress in your browser
5) Done!

#### Disclaimer
Unfortunately, the pickle model file is too large to be uploaded into Git (i.e. 130MB)
